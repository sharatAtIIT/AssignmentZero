// Instructions:
// use this starter code to write an OpenMP program that uses a function hello()
// the function outputs 4 strings. In parallel, obviously!
// These are your name, and the names of 3 other names.. these are your potential partners in
// this course for a course project
// (Obviously multiple workers must share the job)
//
// Also the master thread outputs the honor code exactly once (so that's not going to be in hello()
// 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void hello();
int main () {

  cout << "Program Ends" << endl;  
  return 0;
}
