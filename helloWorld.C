// Instructions:
// use this starter code to write an OpenMP program that uses a function hello()
// the function outputs 4 strings
// These are your name, and the names of 3 other potential partners in
// this course
// Also the master thread outputs the honor code exactly once.
// Obviously multiple workers must share the job

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void hello();
int main () {

  cout << "Program Ends" << endl;  
  return 0;
